**Flight Simulator**

This is a project of Graphic Design. 

It is a simple flight simulator I made using OpenGL to handle the display. 
The airplane should automatically move forward at a fixed speed. 
The user will control the bank and tilt of the airplane through the arrow keys. Pressing the left (right) arrow key will make the plane roll to its left (right). Pressing the up (down) arrow key will cause the airplane to pitch up (down).

Demo as follows:
